## Overview

This project explores how opinions surrounding coffee differ in major cities along the West Coast, specifically Seattle, Portland, and Los Angeles. In order to do this, I used a Twitter web crawler to identify tweets from a given location containing the search parameter "coffee". I then used this data to create word clouds for each city containing common words that appeared in the tweets. For each word cloud, I decided to only keep words that appeared in ten or more tweets. With Seattle being known for its coffee culture, I was curious to see if similar values were appreciated in major cities of the same region.

## Reflection

There seems to be quite a bit of variation between the three word clouds. Seattle's seems to be focused on the social aspect of coffee with some of its largest words being "chat" and "welcome" while Los Angeles is centered around needing it early in the day in order to function with words like "morning", "up", and "need". Portland's results are all over the place with its bigger words being "good", "make", and "go". Words that appeared across all three cities were "anytime" and "work" which may suggest that each city's coffee drinkers are happy to enjoy some despite what time it is and especially on work days. Seattle also contained word's like "digital", "tech", and "futurist" which reminds us of the importance of the tech industry in that area. When looking at all three word clouds together, it is also obvious that Seattle's cloud is much more dense than the others which could be due to more people tweeting about coffee in this city over the other two. This is not too surprising as Seattle residents are known for being coffee enthusiasts.

While working on this project, I was most surprised by the word cloud for Portland as there were much fewer words that appeared at least ten times in tweets compared to Seattle and Los Angeles. I have visited this city on multiple occasions and the coffee scene seemed similar to that of Seattle, so I was surprised to see how much they differed.

If I were to improve upon this project in the future, I would try to account for word phrases rather than just singular words. For example, "wake up" would be together instead of being split into "wake" and "up". Some words may appear to have more significance than they should if they were part of other phrases but got counted up together.
